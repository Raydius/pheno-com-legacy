Oh, and one other element: someone who can guide the athlete into using all of these attributes together to peak at just the right time. While the high-performing athlete comes with many of the aforementioned assets, it is often a coach who can be a rudder, keeping the path steady, being that one more voice to get the best out of the athlete. US swim coach Bruce Gemmell is that rudder for Olympic champion and world record holder Katy Ledecky. A former top-ranked college swimmer, Geddell became afraid of success at a high level, left the sport and went into engineering where his innovations garnered multiple patents. When he returned to swimming to coach, he had the ultimate opportunity to coach Ledecky just after the 2012 Olympics where she won gold and set an American record at just 15 years old. The obvious goal was to keep her constantly improving, but through lessons learned in his previous experiences that kept him from succeeding as a swimmer yet propelled him to succeed as an innovative engineer, he developed an ability to not only guide Ledecky to even greater success, he did it in a way that brought out the best in both of them. Gemmell has called coaching, â€œpart science, part art, part witchcraft, part seat of our pants. It's really just a combination of those.â€ It's a really great reminder that, as much as innovative technology helps advance records and performances, there is no replacing the human element.
