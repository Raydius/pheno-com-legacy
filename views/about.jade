					| I first met Phenomenon in 2010 when I was looking for an agency to help launch a Payday Loan Company. Pheno was a small shop and I was sure that we would be one of their biggest clients, so I was excited to talk to them. But when I got them on the phone and explained the brief to them, they weren't interested.
