        "Buying or selling a home is often a complex, fragmented and darned unfriendly process. Xome is a radically better way to do it because it lets you complete everything from the convenience of an app. In just six weeks we built Xome: the first truly integrated way to buy and sell a home. The app lets you list your home, search for a home, make and receive offers, move into escrow and close the deal.",
        "When it came to the TV spot, we created something that spoke to the core of what Xome does, it makes the entire home buying/selling process more transparent. This teaser spot led people to our site where a demo video explained in better detail everything Xome does for the home buyer."

Everyone has restaurants. Everyone has gambling. But what will you get when you come to the SLS Vegas? That was the challenge ahead of us.",

The Sahara represented a different time for Vegas, with different values. And we wanted to bring those feelings back. A new old way to experience Vegas, so-to-speak.

        "Wilson has been around for over 100 years but they've never had a global brand campaign. Since this was their first campaign, we needed to identify what Wilson is all about. What do they stand for? What is their role in the world of sports? Strategically we boiled it down to one simple insight: Wilson is every athlete's faithful weapon. This was important because even though Wilson has a star-studded lineup of professional athletes on their roster, by putting amateurs and kids on the same level we were truly celebrating all athletes.",
        "Since we didn't have a massive media buy, we had to figure out a way to leverage social media and get our fans to participate in the idea. So we let kids upload videos of themselves playing, which we then edited into the spot and sent back out to them.",
        "Beyond the brand spot, we created a beautiful bound brand book to handout to employees and we relaunched Wilson.com where watchable content revolved around the equipment."
