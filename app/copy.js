In just a few weeks we named the product. Designed the packaging. Designed the entire app experience. And created the ad campaign around it."

        "Wilson has been around for over 100 years but they’ve never had a global brand campaign. Since this was their first campaign, we needed to identify what Wilson is all about. What do they stand for? What is their role in the world of sports? Strategically we boiled it down to one simple insight: Wilson is every athlete's faithful weapon. This was important because even though Wilson has a star-studded lineup of professional athletes on their roster, by putting amateurs and kids on the same level we were truly celebrating all athletes.",
        "Since we didn’t have a massive media buy, we had to figure out a way to leverage social media and get our fans to participate in the idea. So we let kids upload videos of themselves playing, which we then edited into the spot and sent back out to them.",
        "Beyond the brand spot, we created a beautiful bound brand book to handout to employees and we relaunched Wilson.com where watchable content revolved around the equipment."
